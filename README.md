# Accident-Severity-Classification
Developed models to classify Accident Severity, by performing Feature Selection techniques, to identify the important features in the data.

Imporved the model accuracy from 62% to 76%, by tuning the models(Neural Network, Naiive Bayes & Support Vector Classifier) with hyperparameters.
